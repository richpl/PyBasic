# A BASIC Interpreter - Program like it's 1979!

## Introduction

A simple interactive BASIC interpreter written in Python 3. It is based heavily on material in the excellent book *Writing Interpreters
and Compilers for the Raspberry Pi Using Python* by Anthony J. Dos Reis. However, I have had to adapt the Python interpreter presented
in the book, both to work with the BASIC programming language and to produce an interactive command line interface. The interpreter
therefore adopts the key techniques for interpreter and compiler writing, the use of a lexical analysis stage followed by a recursive descent parser
which implements the context free grammar representing the target programming language.

The interpreter is a homage to the home computers of the early 1980s, and when executed, presents an interactive prompt ('>')
typical of such a home computer. Commands to run, list, save and load BASIC programs can be entered at the prompt as well as
program statements themselves.

The BASIC dialect that has been implemented is slightly simplified, and naturally avoids machine specific instructions,
such as those concerned with sound and graphics for example.

There is reasonably comprehensive error checking. Syntax errors will be picked up and reported on by the
lexical analyser as statements are entered. Runtime errors will highlight the cause and the line number of
the offending statement.

The interpreter can be invoked as follows:

```
$ python interpreter.py
```

## Operators

A limited range of arithmetic expressions are provided. Addition and subtraction have the lowest precedence,
but this can be changed with parentheses.

* **+** - Addition
* **-** - Subtraction
* **\*** - Multiplication
* **/** - Division
* **MOD** (or **%**) - Modulo

```
> 10 PRINT 2 * 3
> 20 PRINT 20 / 10
> 30 PRINT 10 + 10
> 40 PRINT 10 - 10
> 50 PRINT 15 MOD 10
> RUN
6
2
20
0
5
>
```

Additional numerical operations may be performed using numeric functions (see below).

## Commands

Programs may be listed using the **LIST** command:

```
> LIST
10 LET I = 10
20 PRINT I
>
```

A program is executed using the **RUN** command:

```
> RUN
10
>
```

A program may be saved to disk using the **SAVE** command. Note that the full path must be specified within double quotes:

```
> SAVE "C:\path\to\my\file"
Program written to file
>
```

The program may be re-loaded from disk using the **LOAD** command, again specifying the full path using double quotes:

```
> LOAD "C:\path\to\my\file"
Program read from file
>
```

When loading or saving, the .bas extension is assumed if not provided.  If you are loading a simple name (alpha/numbers only) and in the working dir, quotes can be omitted:
```
> LOAD regression
```
Will load regression.bas from the current working directory.

Individual program statements may be deleted by entering their line number only:

```
> 10 PRINT "Hello"
> 20 PRINT "Goodbye"
> LIST
10 PRINT "Hello"
20 PRINT "Goodbye"
> 10
> LIST
20 PRINT "Goodbye"
>
```

The program may be erased entirely from memory using the **NEW** command:

```
> 10 LET I = 10
> LIST
10 LET I = 10
> NEW
> LIST
>
```

Finally, it is possible to terminate the interpreter by issuing the **EXIT** command:

```
> EXIT
c:\
```

On occasion, it might be necessary to force termination of a program and return to the
interpreter, for example, because it is caught in an infinite loop. This can be achieved by
using Ctrl-C to force the program to stop:

```
> 10 PRINT "Hello"
> 20 GOTO 10
> RUN
"Hello"
"Hello"
"Hello"
...
...
<Ctrl-C>
Program terminated
> LIST
10 PRINT "Hello"
20 GOTO 10
>
```

## Programming language constructs

### Statement structure

As per usual in old school BASIC, all program statements must be prefixed with a line number which indicates the order in which the
statements may be executed. There is no renumber command to allow all line numbers to be modified. A statement may be modified or
replaced by re-entering a statement with the same line number:

```
> 10 LET I = 10
> LIST
10 LET I = 10
> 10 LET I = 200
> LIST
10 LET I = 200
>
```

### Variables

Variable types follow the typical BASIC convention. *Simple* variables may contain either strings
or numbers (the latter may be integers or floating point numbers). Likewise *array* variables may contain arrays
of either strings or numbers, but they cannot be mixed in the same array.

Note that all keywords and variable names are case insensitive (and will be converted to upper case internally by the lexical analyser).
String literals will retain their case however. There is no inherent limit on the length of variable names or string literals,
this will be dictated by the limitations of Python. The range of numeric values is also dependent upon the underlying
Python implementation.

Note that variable names may only consist of alphanumeric characters and underscores. However, they
must all begin with an alphabetic character. For example:

* *MY_VAR*
* *MY_VAR6$*
* *VAR77(0, 0)*

are all valid variable names, whereas:

* *5_VAR*
* *_VAR$*
* *66$*

are all invalid.

Numeric variables have no suffix, whereas string variables are always suffixed by '$'. Note that 'I' and 'I$' are
considered to be separate variables. Note that string literals must always be enclosed within double quotes (not single quotes).
Using no quotes will result in a syntax error.

Array variables are defined using the **DIM** statement, which explicitly lists how
many dimensions the array has, and the sizes of those dimensions:

```
> REM DEFINE A THREE DIMENSIONAL NUMERIC ARRAY
> 10 DIM A(3, 3, 3)
```

Note that the index of each dimension always starts at *zero*. So in the above example, valid index values for array *A* will be *0, 1* or *2*
for each dimension. Arrays may have a maximum of three dimensions.

As for simple variables, a string array has its name suffixed by a '$' character, while a numeric array does not carry
a suffix. An attempt to assign a string value to a numeric array or vice versa will generate an error.

Note that the same variable name cannot be used for both an array and a simple variable. For example, the variables
*I$* and *I$(10)* should not be used within the same program, the results may be unpredictable. Also, array variables
with the same name but different *dimensionality* are treated as the same. For example,
using a **DIM** statement to define *I(5)* and then a second **DIM** statement to define *I(5, 5)* will
result in the second definition (the two dimensional array) overwriting the first definition (the one dimensional array).

Array values may be used within any expression, such as in a **PRINT** statement for string values, or in any numerical
expression for number values. However, you must be specific about which array element you are referencing, using the
correct number of in-range indexes. If that particular array value has not yet been assigned, then an error
message will be printed.

```
> 10 DIM MYARRAY(2, 2, 2)
> 20 LET MYARRAY(0, 1, 0) = 56
> 30 PRINT MYARRAY(0, 1, 0)
> RUN
56
> 30 PRINT MYARRAY(0, 0, 0)
> RUN
Empty array value returned in line 30
>
```

As in all implementations of BASIC, there is no garbage collection (not surprising since all variables
have global scope)!

### Program constants

Constants may be defined through the use of the **DATA** statement. They may consist of numeric or string values
and are declared in a comma separated list:

```
> 10 DATA 56, "Hello", 78
```

These values can then later be assigned to variables using the **READ** statement. Note that the type of the value
(string or numeric) must match the type of the variable, otherwise an error message will be triggered. Therefore,
attention should be paid to the relative ordering of constants and variables. Further,
there must be enough constants to fill all of the variables defined in the **READ** statement, or else an
error will be given. This is to ensure that the program is not left in a state where a variable has not been
assigned a value, but nevertheless an attempt to use that variable is made later on in the program.

The constants defined in the **DATA** statement may be consumed using several **READ** statements:

```
> 10 DATA 56, "Hello", 78
> 20 READ FIRSTNUM, STR$
> 30 PRINT FIRSTNUM, " ", STR$
> 40 READ SECONDNUM
> 50 PRINT SECONDNUM
> RUN
56 Hello
78
>
```

The supply of constants may be refreshed by defining more **DATA** statements:

```
> 10 DATA 20
> 20 READ NUM
> 30 PRINT NUM
> 40 DATA 30
> 50 READ NUM
> 60 PRINT NUM
> RUN
20
30
>
```

It is a limitation of this BASIC dialect that it is not possible to assign constants directly to array variables
within a **READ** statement, only simple variables.

### Comments

The **REM** statement is used to indicate a comment, and occupies an entire statement. It has no effect on execution:

```
> 10 REM THIS IS A COMMENT
```

Note that comments will be automatically normalised to upper case.

### Stopping a program

The **STOP** statement may be used to cease program execution. The command **END** has the same effect.

```
> 10 PRINT "one"
> 20 STOP
> 30 PRINT "two"
> RUN
one
>
```

A program will automatically cease execution when it reaches the final statement, so a **STOP** may not be necessary. However
a **STOP** *will* be required if subroutines have been defined at the end of the program, otherwise execution will continue
through to those subroutines without a corresponding subroutine call. This will cause an error when the **RETURN**
statement is processed and the interpreter attempts to return control back to the caller.

### Assignment

Assignment may be made to numeric simple variables (which can contain either integers or floating point numbers) and string simple variables
(string variables are distinguished by their dollar suffix). The interpreter will enforce this division between the two types:

```
> 10 LET I = 10
> 20 LET I$ = "Hello"
```

The **LET** keyword is also optional:

```
> 10 I = 10
```

Array variables may also have values assigned to them. The indexes can be derived from numeric
expressions:

```
> 10 DIM NUMS(3, 3)
> 20 DIM STRS$(3, 3)
> 30 LET INDEX = 0
> 40 LET NUMS(INDEX, INDEX) = 55
> 50 LET STRS$(INDEX, INDEX) = "hello"
```

Attempts to assign the wrong type (number or string) to a numeric or string array, attempts to assign a value to an array by specifying the wrong number
of dimensions, and attempts to assign to an array using an out of range index, will all result in an error.

### Printing to standard output

The **PRINT** statement is used to print to the screen:

```
> 10 PRINT 2 * 4
> RUN
8
> 10 PRINT "Hello"
> RUN
Hello
>
```

Multiple items may be printed by providing a comma separated list. The items in the list will be printed immediately after one
another, so spaces must be inserted if these are required:

```
> 10 PRINT 345, " hello ", 678
> RUN
345 hello 678
>
```

A blank line may be printed by using the **PRINT** statement without arguments:

```
> 10 PRINT "Here is a blank line:"
> 20 PRINT
> 30 PRINT "There it was"
> RUN
Here is a blank line:

There it was
>
```

### Unconditional branching

Like it or loath it, the **GOTO** statement is an integral part of BASIC, and is used to transfer control to the statement with the specified line number:

```
> 10 PRINT "Hello"
> 20 GOTO 10
> RUN
Hello
Hello
Hello
...
```

### Subroutine calls

The **GOSUB** statement is used to generate a subroutine call. Control is passed back to the program at the
next statement after the call by a **RETURN** statement at the end of the subroutine:

```
> 10 GOSUB 100
> 20 PRINT "This happens after the subroutine"
> 30 STOP
> 100 REM HERE IS THE SUBROUTINE
> 110 PRINT "This happens in the subroutine"
> 120 RETURN
> RUN
This happens in the subroutine
This happens after the subroutine
>
```

Note that without use of the **STOP** statement, execution will run past the last statement
of the main program (line 30) and will re-execute the subroutine again (at line 100).

Subroutines may be nested, that is, a subroutine call may be made within another subroutine.

A subroutine may also be called using the **ON-GOSUB** statement (see Conditional branching
below).

### Loops

Bounded loops are achieved through the use of **FOR-NEXT** statements. The loop is controlled by a numeric
loop variable that is incremented or decremented from a start value to an end value. The loop terminates when
the loop variable reaches the end value. The loop variable must also be specified in the **NEXT**
statement at the end of the loop.

```
> 10 FOR I = 1 TO 3
> 20 PRINT "hello"
> 30 NEXT I
> RUN
hello
hello
hello
>
```

Loops may be nested within one another.

The **STEP** statement allows the loop variable to be incremented or decremented by
a specified amount. For example, to count down from 5 in steps of -1:

```
> 10 FOR I = 5 TO 1 STEP -1
> 20 PRINT I
> 30 NEXT I
> RUN
5
4
3
2
1
>
```

Note that the start value, end value and step value need not be integers, but can be floating
point numbers as well. If the loop variable was previously assigned in the program, its value will
be replaced by the start value, it will not be evaluated.

### Conditional branching

Conditional branches are implemented using the **IF-THEN-ELSE** statement. The expression is evaluated and the appropriate jump
made depending upon the result of the evaluation.

```
> 10 REM PRINT THE GREATEST NUMBER
> 20 LET I = 10
> 30 LET J = 20
> 40 IF I > J THEN 50 ELSE 70
> 50 PRINT I
> 60 GOTO 80
> 70 PRINT J
> 80 REM FINISHED
> RUN
20
>
```

Note that the **ELSE** clause is optional and may be omitted. In this case, the **THEN** branch is taken if the
expression evaluates to true, otherwise the following statement is executed.

You can optionally give the **GOTO** keyword before your line numbers. This is for compatibility with other BASIC dialects. e.g. `40 IF I > J THEN GOTO 50 ELSE GOTO 70`

It is also possible to call a subroutine depending upon the result of a conditional expression
using the **ON-GOSUB** statement. If the expression evaluates to true, then the subroutine is
called, otherwise execution continues to the next statement without making the call:

```
> 10 LET I = 10
> 20 LET J = 5
> 30 ON I > J GOSUB 100
> 40 STOP
> 100 REM THE SUBROUTINE
> 110 PRINT "I is greater than J"
> 120 RETURN
> RUN
I is greater than J
>
```

Allowable relational operators are:

* '=' (equal, note that in BASIC the same operator is used for assignment)
* '<' (less than)
* '>' (greater than)
* '<=' (less than or equal)
* '>=' (greater than or equal)
* '<>' / '!=' (not equal)

The logical operators **AND** and **OR** are also provided to allow you to join two or more expressions. The **NOT** operator can also be given before an expression.

*=* and *<>* can also be considered logical operators. However, unlike **AND** or **OR** they can't be used to join more than two expressions.

| Inputs |       | *AND* | *OR*  | *=*   | *<>* / *!=* |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------------|
| FALSE  | FALSE | FALSE | FALSE | TRUE  | FALSE       |
| TRUE   | FALSE | FALSE | TRUE  | FALSE | TRUE        |
| TRUE   | TRUE  | TRUE  | TRUE  | TRUE  | FALSE       |

| Input | NOT   |
|-------|-------|
| TRUE  | FALSE |
| FALSE | TRUE  |

Example:

```
> 10 a = 10
> 20 b = 20
> 30 IF NOT a > b AND b = 20 OR a >= 5 THEN 60
> 40 PRINT "Test failed!"
> 50 STOP
> 60 PRINT "Test passed!"
> RUN
Test passed!
```

Expressions can be inside brackets to change the order of evaluation. Compare the output when line 30 is changed:

```
> 30 IF NOT a > b AND (b = 20 OR a >= 5) THEN 60
> RUN
Test failed!
```

### Ternary Functions

As an alternative to branching, Ternary functions are provided.

* **IFF**(x, y, z) - Evaluates *x* and returns *y* if true, otherwise returns *z*. *y* and *z* are expected to be numeric.
* **IF$**(x, y$, z$) - As above, but *y$* and *z$* are expected to be strings.

```
> 10 LET I = 10
> 20 LET J = 5
> 30 PRINT IF$(I > J, "I is greater than J", "I is not greater than J")
> 40 K = IFF(I > J, 20, 30)
> 50 PRINT K
> RUN
I is greater than J
20
```

### User input

The **INPUT** statement is used to solicit input from the user:

```
> 10 INPUT A
> 20 PRINT A
> RUN
? 22
22
>
```

The default input prompt of '? ' may be changed by inserting a prompt string, which must be terminated
by a colon, thus:

```
> 10 INPUT "Input a number - ": A
> 20 PRINT A
> RUN
Input a number - 22
22
>
```

Multiple items may be input by supplying a comma separated list. Input variables will be assigned
to as many input values as supplied at run time. If there are more input values supplied than input
variables, excess commas will be left in place. Conversely, if not enough input values are
supplied, an error message will be printed and the user will be asked to re-input the values again.

Further, numeric input values must be valid numbers (integers or floating point).

```
> 10 INPUT "Num, Str, Num: ": A, B$, C
> 20 PRINT A, B$, C
> RUN
Num, Str, Num: 22, hello!, 33
22 hello!33
>
```

A mismatch between the input value and input variable type will trigger an error, and the user will be asked
to re-input the values again.

It is a limitation of this BASIC dialect that it is not possible to assign constants directly to array variables
within an **INPUT** statement, only simple variables.

### Numeric functions

Selected numeric functions are provided, and may be used with any numeric expression. For example,
the square root function, **SQR**, can be applied expressions consisting of both literals and variables:

```
> 10 LET I = 6
> 20 PRINT SQR(I - 2)
> RUN
2.0
>
```

Allowable numeric functions are:

* **ABS**(x) - Calculates the absolute value of *x*

* **ATN**(x) - Calculates the arctangent of *x*

* **COS**(x) - Calculates the cosine of *x*, where *x* is an angle in radians

* **EXP**(x) - Calculates the exponential of *x*, *e^x* where *e*=2.718281828

* **INT**(x) - Rounds down numbers to the lowest whole integer less than or equal to *x*

* **LOG**(x) - Calculates the natural logarithm of *x*

* **MAX**(x, y[, z]...) - Returns the highest value from a list of expressions

* **MIN**(x, y[, z]...) - Returns the lowest value from a list of expressions

```
> 10 PRINT MAX(-2, 0, 1.5, 4)
> 20 PRINT MIN(-2, 0, 1.5, 4)
> RUN
> 4
> -2
```

* **PI** - Returns the value of pi.

* **POW**(x, y) - Calculates *x* to the power *y*

* **RND** - Generates a pseudo random number N, where *0 <= N < 1*. Can be
reset using the **RANDOMIZE** instruction with an optional seed value: e.g.

```
> 10 RANDOMIZE 100
> 20 PRINT RND
> RUN
0.1456692551041303
>
```

Random integers can be generated by combining **RND** and **INT**: e.g.

```
> 10 PRINT INT(RND * 6) + 1
> RUN
3
> RUN
6
>
```

Seeds may not produce the same result on another platform.

* **RNDINT**(*lo*, *hi*) - Generates a pseudo random integer N, where *lo* <= N <= *hi*. Uses the same seed as above.

* **ROUND**(x) - Rounds number to the nearest integer.

* **SIN**(x) - Calculates the sine of *x*, where *x* is an angle in radians

* **SQR**(x) - Calculates the square root of *x*

* **TAN**(x) - Calculates the tangent of *x*, where *x* is an angle in radians

### String functions

Some functions are provided to help you manipulate strings. Functions that return a string
have a '$' suffix like string variables.

Note that unlike some other BASIC variants, string positions start at *0*.

The functions are:

* **ASC**(x$) - Returns the character code for *x$*. *x$* is expected to be a single character.
Note that despite the name, this function can return codes outside the ASCII range.
* **CHR$**(x) - Returns the character specified by character code *x*.
* **INSTR**(x$, y$[, start[, end]]) - Returns position of *y$* inside *x$*, optionally start searching
at position *start* and end at *end*. Returns -1 if no match found.
* **LEN**(x$) - Returns the length of *x$*.
* **LOWER$**(x$) - Returns a lower-case version of *x$*.
* **MID$**(x$, y[, z]) - Returns part of *x$* starting at position *y* and ending at *z*. *z* can
be omitted to get the rest of the string.  If *y* or *z* are negative, the position is counted
backwards from the end of the string.
* **STR$**(x) - Returns a string representation of numeric value *x*.
* **UPPER$**(x$) - Returns an upper-case version of *x$*
* **VAL**(x$) - Attempts to convert *x$* to a numeric value. If *x$* is not numeric, returns 0.

Examples for **ASC**, **CHR$** and **STR$**
```
> 10 I = 65
> 20 J$ = CHR$(I) + " - " + STR$(I)
> 30 PRINT J$
> 40 PRINT ASC("Z")
RUN
A - 65
90
```

**TAN**(*numerical-expression*) - Calculates the tangent value of the result of *numerical-expression*

**UPPER$**(*string-expression*) - Returns an upper-case version of the result of *string-expression*

**VAL**(*string-expression*) - Attempts to convert the result of *string-expression* to a numeric value. If it is not numeric, returns 0.

## Architecture

The interpreter is implemented using the following Python classes:

* basictoken.py - This implements the tokens that are produced by the lexical analyser. The class mostly defines token categories
and provides a simple token pretty printing method.

* lexer.py - This class implements the lexical analyser. Lexical analysis is performed on one statement at a time, as each statement is
entered into the interpreter.

* basicparser.py - This class implements a parser for individual BASIC statements. This is somewhat inefficient in that statements,
for example those in a loop, must be re-parsed every time they are executed. However, such a model allows us to develop an
interactive interpreter where statements can be gradually added to the program between runs.
Since the parser is oriented to the processing of individual statements, it uses a
signalling mechanism (using FlowSignal objects) to its caller indicate when program level actions are required, such as recording the return address
following a subroutine jump. However, the parser does maintain a symbol table (implemented as a dictionary) in order to record
the value of variables as they are assigned.

* program.py - This class implements an actual basic program, which is represented as a dictionary. Dictionary keys are
statement line numbers and the corresponding value is the list of tokens that make up the statement with that line number.
Statements are executed by calling the parser to parse one statement at a time. This class
maintains a program counter, an indication of which line number should be executed next. The program counter is incremented to the next line
number in sequence, unless executed a statement has resulted in a branch. The parser indicates this by signalling to the program object that
calls it using a FlowSignal object.

* interpreter.py - This class provides the interface to the user. It allows the user to both input program statements and to execute
the resulting program. It also allows the user to run commands, for example to save and load programs, or to list them.

* flowsignal.py - Implements a FlowSignal object that allows the parser to signal a change in control flow. For example, as
the result of a jump defined in the statement just parsed (GOTO, conditional branch evaluation), a loop decision,
a subroutine call, or program termination. This paradigm of using the parser to simply parse individual statements, the Program
object to make control flow decisions and to track execution, and a signalling mechanism to allow the parser to signal
control flow changes to the Program object, is used consistently throughout the implementation.

## Open issues

* It is not possible to renumber a program. This would require considerable extra functionality.
* Negative values are printed with a space (e.g. '- 5') in program listings because of tokenization. This does not affect functionality.
* Decimal values less than one must be expressed with a leading zero (i.e. 0.34 rather than .34)
* User input values cannot be directly assigned to array variables in an **INPUT** or **READ** statement
* Strings representing numbers (e.g. "10") can actually be assigned to numeric variables in **INPUT** and **READ** statements without an
error, Python will silently convert them to integers.
